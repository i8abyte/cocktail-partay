# Cocktail Partay
Access a database of cocktails and their ingredients on your devices.
This project was inspired by the cocktail parties I have attended where everyone is required to make cocktails for everyone else.
I started this project as a web app with the intention of making it a progressive web app (PWA), but decided to restart it as a React Native cross-platform monorepo.
